                    Binary Search Tree (BSTree)
                    ---------------------------


Description:
------------
In Node.java and BSTree.java you are given skeleton code for a binary search tree,
where each node contains a string. Nodes to the left are less and to the right greater.
In addition you are given a program Test.java that allows you to "test out" a binary
search tree, and also draw a schema of that tree (the structure but not content).


What needs to be done: 
----------------------
Implement the methods in the file BSTree.java and test these

   - insert, to insert a string into the tree
   - find, to a node that contains a given string
   - height, deliver the height of the tree
   - preorder, inorder, postorder traversals of the tree
   - breadth first and depth first search (bfs & dfs)

Sketch some of the trees (data12.txt) that you build by hand so that you are familiar with:

   - insertion into a binary search tree
   - deletion from a binary search tree
   - the traversals
   - the height of the tree
   - the shape of the tree


Getting started:
----------------
 1. Make a directory to work in and then copy across all files
    in this directory (including this one). 

 2. Compile all the java files
    - javac *.java

 3. Run the Test program
    - java Test
    - java Test data12.txt
    - java Test animals.txt
    - java Test heartSutra.txt
    - java Test data2415.txt

 4. Modify BSTree.java, implementing the methods 
    - insert, find, height, preorder, inorder, postorder, postorder, bfs, dfs


What you should learn:
----------------------
You will become familiar with "non-linear" data structures and the close
binding of data structures and the algorithms that work upon them. You will
also sharpen up skills required for intricate programming (small and detailed)


NOTE:
-----
(1) You can read in data into the binary search tree on the command line
    Data is in the files *.txt

(2) There is a "feature" in that the first time you draw a tree you need to
    bring the cursor back into the command line window.
